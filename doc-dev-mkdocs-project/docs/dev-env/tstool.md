# Development Environment / TSTool

The CDSS TSTool software is used to process tables containing basin/day/statistic columns into
time series products such as graphs showing snow water equivalent (SWE) over the snow season,
and comparisons of the current year with other years.

The latest TSTool software version is available from the
[Open Water Foundation TSTool website](http://openwaterfoundation.org/software-tools/tstool).
Note that OWF is working on a project to move TSTool software to an open source project and a different download page may be implemented
in the future.  The [CDSS website version of TSTool](http://cdss.state.co.us/software/Pages/TSTool.aspx) is often a bit behind the latest version being released by OWF.

Download the TSTool installer for Windows and install into the normal location.

TSTool will be called in batch mode to create snow products.
TSTool installs as a different version and therefore the code that calls TSTool should be specific about which version is being used.
