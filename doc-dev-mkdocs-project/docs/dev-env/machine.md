# Development Environment / Machine

The target deployment environment is Windows 7/10 64-bit.
Therefore, the development environment is Windows 10 64-bit to try to minimize deployment issues.

Because of the dependency on the QGIS/pQGIS environment, with its bundled Python version,
other Python versions have not been evaluated for pyQGIS.

The software developer is expected to be able to install and use necessary software on the development machine.
