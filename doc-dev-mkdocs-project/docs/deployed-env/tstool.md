# Deployed Environment / TSTool

**TODO smalers 2016-12-04 need to describe how to install the SNODAS tools.
For example, might install in `/home/snodastools/CDSS/SNODAS-Tools` or in `/opt` on the Linux VM.
Need to finalize script names, configuration files, location of data, etc. as per the [Software Design](../software-design/overview).**
OWF will install this software once the VM is available.

### SNODAS Tools Configuration

**TODO smalers 2016-12-04 need to describe final configuration of the SNODAS tools once all software components are installed.
This will be similar to the development environment for file structure.**

### Test SNODAS Tools

**TODO smalers 2016-12-04 need to describe how to do basic testing to make sure things are working**
