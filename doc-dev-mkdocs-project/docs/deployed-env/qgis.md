## Installing QGIS ##

The QGIS website has easy to follow instructions for installing on the Linux Debian/Ubuntu
distributions. Each command was followed in the order they provided, and is located
[here](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu). This is for
installing the most recent version; more instructions to install specific releases are
under the **Repositories** section just below that.
