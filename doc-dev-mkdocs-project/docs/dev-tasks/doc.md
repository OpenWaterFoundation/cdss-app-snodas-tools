# Development Tasks / Documentation

**TODO smalers 2016-12-04 insert guidelines for documentation**

## Code Documentation

Python code documentation should follow Python "docustring" conventions, as per the following resources:

* [Docstring on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring)
* [Python docstring conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

## Developer Documentation Website (MkDocs)

Developer documentation (this documentation) is created using MkDocs and results in a static website.
MkDocs should have been [installed previously](../dev-env/mkdocs/).  See the following resources for MarkDown:

* [MkDocs - Writing your docs](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/)
* [Markdown cheatsheet - GitHub, adap-p](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

### Folder Structure

Create all developer documentation under the `doc-dev-markdown-project` folder as per MkDocs.
Edit the `mkdocs.yml` file to create the documentation outline and then create content in the `docs` folder.
Guidelines for the content are:

* Create a limited number of top-level folders (should already be in place).
* Create Markdown files for each page, for example `myfile.md`.
* If images are needed, create a parallel folder for images, for example `myfile-images`.
* Create PNG images, for example using GIMP software and save in the images folder.

### Markdown Conventions

**TODO smalers 2016-12-05 Need to add a few conventions here**
