# Development Tasks / Deploy

The software that is created and tested in the development environment via the PyCharm IDE must be deployed to the
[operational environment](../deployed-env/overview/),
which does not include PyCharm.

**TODO smalers 2016-12-04 need to insert documentation for how to package the SNODAS tools for deployment.**
