# Development Tasks / Future Enhancements

The following future enhancements have been identified:

1. Add simple, yet beneficial, testing to the SNODAS Tools with pyTest. 
2. Create a helper Python script to move pertinent files from the development 
environment to the deployed environment. 
3. Edit the SNODAS_utilities.py script to retry downloading daily SNODAS data
if an error occurs on the initial attempt. Build a waiting function within 
the second attempt to deter from error of high FTP traffic. 
4. Create a helper Python script to compute the intensity of overlapping basins 
and gaps within the watershed basin input shapefile.
