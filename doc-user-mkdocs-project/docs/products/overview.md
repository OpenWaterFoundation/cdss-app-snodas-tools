# SNODAS Tools Products / Overview

The SNODAS Tools process the SNODAS grids and basin boundaries into output products that are useful for water supply planning and decisions.
This documentation provides a summary of the data products and links to visualize and download the products.
Because the products vary in format, results are made available using multiple platforms:

* [CDSS Map Viewer](http://cdss.state.co.us/onlineTools/Pages/MapViewer.aspx) - provides map for most recent day's basin snow water equivalent
* [Open Water Foundation Project Page](http://projects.openwaterfoundation.org/owf-proj-co-cwcb-2016-snodas/index.html) - provides an archive of each day's products

The following sections provide details about each product.
