# SNODAS Tools Products / Overview

The SNODAS Tools process the SNODAS grids and basin boundaries into output products that are useful for water supply planning and decisions.
This documentation provides a summary of the data products and links to visualize and download the products.
Because the products vary in format, results are made available using multiple platforms:

* [CDSS Map Viewer](http://cdss.state.co.us/onlineTools/Pages/MapViewer.aspx) - provides map for most recent day's basin snow water equivalent
* [Open Water Foundation Project Page]() - provides an archive of each day's products

The following sections provide details about each product.

## Basin List

**TODO smalers 2016-12-11 provide links here again to basin layer and table**

## Colorado SNODAS Grid

Each day's SNODAS grid, clipped to Colorado basin extent is saved on the SNODAS Tools computer as a XXXX file, using the naming convention xxxx.
These files are made available on the web to facilitate review of the input SNODAS grids.

**TODO smalers 2016-12-11 provide information for how to access.
Include one or more screen shot examples and explain.
Note it is possible that we could distribute the current day's grid to the map viewer as a GeoTiff - need to discuss with the State.**

## Basin Map with Statistics

The basin layer for each day is saves as a xxxx file with naming convention xxxx.
The file is available in the CDSS Map Viewer in the xxx group and layer name xxxx.

**TODO smalers 2016-12-11 provide information for how to access in Map Viewer and OWF project page on Amazon.
Describe how we are producing GeoJSON to facilitate access use.
Provide example and explain.**

**TODO smalers 2016-12-11 Include examples and explain.
Need to provide link to products on OWF project page.
Also need to discuss with the State how they might provide access to graphs.**
