**Overview**

The SNODAS Tools calculate daily snowpack statistics of watershed basins based on the published values of 
the SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) national data grids. This section explains the details of the input
data with respect to the SNODAS Tools. 

The SNODAS Tools calculate daily zonal snowpack statistics of input watershed basins. 
Zonal statistics are statistics calculated by zone where the zones are defined by an
input zone dataset and the values are defined by a raster grid. The input zone dataset
for the SNODAS Tools is 
[an input watershed basin shapefile](data.md#input-zone-dataset-watershed-basins). 
The raster grid for the SNODAS Tools is the daily [SNOw Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) national data grid](data.md#snodas-data-grids). 

This section describes both the daily SNODAS data grids and the input watershed basin shapefile.
