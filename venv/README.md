This folder contains Python virtual environments used by PyCharm to develop the SNODAS Tools software.
The virtual environments are initialized from a QGIS Python version and are named similar to the following,
using QGIS version 3.22.16 as an example.

| **Virtual Environment Folder** | **Description** |
| -- | -- |
| `venv-qgis-3.22.16-python39` | Stand-alone QGIS version 3.22.16 using Python 3.9 from QGIS (`C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.22.16\apps\Python39`). |

The developer documentation describes how PyCharm, QGIS, Python, and repository files are integrated.
